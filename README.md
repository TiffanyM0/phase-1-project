Project Name: Free Dictionary Application
Author: Tiffany Wanjiru

Description:

This application aims to get the definitions, phonetics, part of speech of an word in the English language. 

I use the public API url(https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/${word}) to get the results.
They are then pushed into the index.html. 

The site will display a message if the word typed is not an english word.
